# Platforms

Each platform has its own folder with four focused areas:

- `ui` — Screens, components, styling, and UX flows.
- `api` — HTTP endpoints exposed by the platform.
- `backend` — Auth, storage, and server-side logic.
- `database` — Data ownership and Prisma schema usage.

## Platform Index

- `landing-page/README.md`
- `teacher-platform/README.md`
- `students-platform/README.md`

## Cross-Platform Indexes

- `api-index.md` — Single-sheet API endpoint list.
